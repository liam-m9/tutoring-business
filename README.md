# GCSE Math Tutoring - Simplified

Marketing site for a GCSE maths tutor I built it as a client project. 

When someone submits the contact form, Cloudflare Turnstile checks they're not a bot. The form data then gets posted to a Python Flask API on AWS Lambda. The API writes the inquiry into Postgres.

## Stack

- Static HTML / CSS / JS in `docs/`, hosted on Vercel
- Python 3.13 + Flask on AWS Lambda with API Gateway in front
- PostgreSQL on Neon
- Cloudflare Turnstile for bot protection
- AWS SAM to deploy the backend

## Repo layout

    docs/      # static site
    backend/   # flask api + SAM template

## Backend

See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for setup and deploy steps.

## Frontend

Vercel serves `docs/` as the output directory. Pushing to `main` triggers a redeploy.

## Notes

- Turnstile is checked on the server. An earlier version had a shared secret hardcoded in the public JS, which was pointless. That is gone.
- All SQL uses parameters. No string concat.
- CORS is set up in the SAM template so API Gateway handles the preflight, not Flask.
- Rate limiting is in-memory on the Lambda. It resets on cold start but that is fine at this traffic level.
